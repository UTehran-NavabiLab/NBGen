Detection:
    detect ff
    detect clock port 
    goal: every internal clock must be (somehow) connected to primary input port

    alg.
        detect global clock
        search through every register element 
            find clock port
            check if it's directly (or ...) connected to global clock *** 
            if it's not GO TO Repair

Repair: 
    assumption> circuit has a single global clock 
    put MUX to connect all (violated) clock ports to that global clock

    alg.
