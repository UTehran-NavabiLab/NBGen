-------------------- TODO list --------------------

counter scan simulation on systemc
sayac scan simulation on systemc
automating fault simulation process:
    - choose the right "fault-injector" module (based on comb/seq) and copy that in test folder
        check if there is any DFF
    - automatic testbench Gen (for combinational and seq):
        for seq circuit it's important to know what is the name of clock and reset
        we should order input_ports in way that special pin are always in same order
    - put them all in one folder and call "make" file

fix multi-file inputs

why the number of faults generated by Atalanta is different from yours
modules with a name equal to one of the signals would cause error on systemc (see counter example)

-------------------- Done --------------------

sayac Netlist
verify systemc vs vhdl
fix atalanta float problem
lenght of test data is not fix: fault injector module : fixed using templated class
